reMath Library
====================

reMath is a simple yet convenient C++ math library developed primarily for 
graphics-related operations.

It provides an easy way to operate such mathematical entities as 2D and 3D 
vectors, square matrix, and quaternion. The aim was to ease 
development process for OpenGL-based projects.

The library is intended to be cross-platform, however currently only 
Windows binding is fully tested. Linux and Mac OS X support is planned 
for the nearest future.

# Classes Overview
There are currently five main classes in the library:
* Vec2d - represents a 2d vector.
* Vec3d - represents a 3d vector.
* Quaternion - a 4d vector.
* Matrix3 - a 3x3 rotation-only matrix.
* Matrix4 - a 4x4 rotation & translation matrix.
