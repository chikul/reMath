reMath Library
====================

reMath is a simple yet convenient C++ math library developed primarily for 
graphics-related operations.

It provides an easy way to operate such mathematical entities as 2D and 3D 
[vector][]s, square [matrix][], and [quaternion][]. The aim was to ease 
development process for [OpenGL][]-based projects.

The library is intended to be cross-platform, however currently only 
Windows binding is fully tested. Linux and Mac OS X support is planned 
for the nearest future.
